# Audio-transcription
AIM-_ Training a Deep learning Recurrent Neural Network based Model which can be employed to print a transcription of any audio file in English Language integrated with web-dev.

Introduction - An audio transcription app based on machine learning automatically converts spoken words from an audio recording into written text using machine learning algorithms trained on large datasets of speech data .These apps can handle different accents and speaking styles,save time and effort,and provide a high level of accuracy and flexibility. This project aims to build an app that transcribes audio files of various tones and styles into text using a deep learning approach that can correctly predict the user's description of the message in the expected emotion and tone modulation.
